# History

For some reason this extension was patched in February 13th 2023.
The patch made the images come blur instead of the previous way of
providing plain images getting blurred by css.

This patch has been reverted. I guess they patch it
in valentines in order to increase profits and maybe
let the people who use these kind of extensions have it
their way for the rest of the year.

This was done together with github.com/edenidan
